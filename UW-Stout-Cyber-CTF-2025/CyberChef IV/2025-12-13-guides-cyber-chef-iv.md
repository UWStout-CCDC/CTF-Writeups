Can you decode this ciphertext?

`4e544d314e44526d4e5455314e44517a4e5451304e6a64694e47553059544d304e6a6b334d5459334e7a59334d444d784e6a6b30595459314e444d304e6a5a694e6a6b324e5452694e4463325a4451304e7a41324e7a4d794d7a41334f5455344e6a45314f544d774e5455305a44646b`

## Walkthrough

Welcome back to the CyberChef Walkthroughs! Here we are going to go through the basics of CyberChef, with a few extra challenges at the end for you to work on.

This time, we are going to be super duper lazy, and solve the entire challenge using a single block!

I know, I know, its a lot to ask, but trust me its possible. We're going to learn about the `Magic` block this time.

The Magic block has four main components to it: Depth, Intensive Mode, Extensive Language Support, and Crib.

### Depth

Depth allows you to specify how "deep" or how many layers of encoding might be on the cipher text. For example, the cipher text in CyberChef II had 2 layers of encoding.

### Intensive Mode

Intensive mode makes the Magic block try more complex combinations than it normally would. Be careful, this can crash the application depending on the ciphertext.

### Extensive language Support

This is a mode you might not regularly use. This let's CyberChef know you want it to check against all languages, not just the most common ones.

### Crib

This tells CyberChef what the start of the plaintext is, so it can only show you ones that contain the crib in it.

Now that you've learned all about `Magic`, you can try and solve this challenge.
