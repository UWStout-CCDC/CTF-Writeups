I don't really have a "solution" for this challenge as it was pretty much meant to be impossible to solve. It was more of a test to see if anyone was even able to find an image with practically no information on it. The picture is located in an Arctic Research Facility in Svalbard, Norway.

That being said, the only way I can really see actually solving this is to use ChatGPT, which I found out is surprisingly good at geolocation. Peyton and I were testing some stuff and he made me aware that ChatGPT was able to narrow down the location to the island the picture was taken from, Svalbard.

Below is the link to the photosphere used to create the challenge along with the name of the person who uploaded the photosphere.
